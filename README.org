* Hemera, or a Haskell Scheme

  Hemera is my implementation of the Scheme from Write Yourself a Scheme
  in 48 Hours.

  Hemera is the Greek goddess of the day, which is a funny joke because
  this is all done at night.

  It's also strongly influenced in its behaviour by Common Lisp, whose
  notable imprint at this early stage is providing better error messages.
